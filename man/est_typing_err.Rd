\description{
Estimates the Expected Number of Errors in a Data Entry Job
}
\details{
The function calcualtes (Bayesian posterior) estimates for the expected number of errors (\code{quantity='mean'}) or the 
upper bound of the 95\% (Bayesian) credible interval (\code{quantity='95q'}) in the population of entered values when a 
random sample of \code{S} entered values contains \code{F} errors. For a discussion on the type of inference, see Winkler 
et al. (2002).

The calculations are done assuming a Beta-distribution prior over the proportion of errors for all entered values. The 
users must supply hyper-parameters for the Beta-prior. The function provides two informed default hyper-parameter sets. 
Both induce an informed prior and are formed from data about postmen's performance in typing post codes as reported in 
Baddeley/Longman (1978). 

The first prior (\code{prior='postmen'}) says that the a-priori the proportion of errors relative to the total number of entered 
values is about 1.4\% with a variance 0.7. The second prior (\code{prior='bad_postmen'}) is more conservative saying that 
it is about 2.1\% with a variance of 1.1. Users can also supply their own prior using a named vector that contains the alpha 
and beta hyper-parameters for the Beta prior (the output of \code{\link{calc_beta_param}} can be used).
